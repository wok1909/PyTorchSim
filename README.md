# PyTorchSim: A Comprehensive, Fast, and Accurate NPU Simulation Framework
[![Docker Image CI](https://github.com/PSAL-POSTECH/PyTorchSim/actions/workflows/docker-image.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/PSAL-POSTECH/PyTorchSim/actions/workflows/docker-image.yml)

PyTorchSim is a comprehensive, high-speed, cycle-accurate NPU simulation framework.
- We define a RISC-V-based NPU architecture and implement PyTorch compiler backend to run inference & training for PyTorch models.
- Achieved high speed and accuracy with our novel Tile-Level Simulation (TLS) with compiler-generated Tile-Operation Graph (TOG), exploiting deterministic tile compute latency.
- A generic and extensible NPU architecture based on RISC-V vector extension.
- The functional simulator supports code correctness validation and data-dependent timing simulation.

**Figure description**: we compare the simulation speed of PyTorchSim over [Accel-sim](https://accel-sim.github.io/) (a GPU simulator with Tensor Core model) as GPUs are widely used for deep learning and such a GPU simulator can be used to study systems for deep learning. We also include [mNPUsim](https://github.com/casys-kaist/mNPUsim) in the comparison. On the x-axis, we vary the size and workloads.

**Figure description**: PyTorchSim achieves significantly better accuracy than others ([SCALE-Simv3](https://github.com/scalesim-project/scale-sim-v3), [mNPUsim](https://github.com/casys-kaist/mNPUsim), [Timeloop](https://github.com/NVlabs/timeloop), [MAESTRO](https://github.com/maestro-project/maestro)) by supporting various optimizations, data transformations, and general vector operations. It achieved an 11.5% MAE (Mean Absolute Error) of runtime relative to the real TPUv3. -->

## PyTorchSim Framework Overview
![Overview](/docs/overview.jpg)
PyTorchSim consists of **two main** components:
- **Compiler**: Integrated with the [PyTorch2](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) compiler stack; it generates NPU machine code and TOG for existing PyTorch models.
- **TOGSim**: Executes TOG for high-speed simulation and accurately models shared resources (DRAM, NoC) through integrated cycle-accurate simulators ([BookSim](https://github.com/booksim/booksim2) and [Ramulator2](https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/ramulator2)).

PyTorchSim **supports**:
- DNN inference and [training](#training)
- Data-dependent timing modeling (e.g. sparsity)
- [One continuous TOGSim session](#one-togsim-session-one-continuous-log) (single log across multiple forwards)
- [Multi-tenancy](#multi-tenancy)
- [Compiler optimizations](#compiler-optimizations)
- [Mapping](#mapping)
- [L2 Cache](#l2-cache) (persistent cache)

- Batched GEMM
- Convolution
- Elementwise
- Reduction
- Batchnorm
- Layernorm
- Softmax
- Transpose
- View
- Activation
- Pooling

## Getting Started
### Quick start with pre-built Docker image

To download the latest Docker image and set up the environment, use the following commands:

```bash
# Run the Docker container
docker run -it --ipc=host --name torchsim -w /workspace/PyTorchSim ghcr.io/psal-postech/torchsim-ci:v1.1.0 bash
```
### Manual Setting (Optional)
This script builds [Gem5](https://github.com/PSAL-POSTECH/gem5.git), [LLVM](https://github.com/PSAL-POSTECH/llvm-project.git), and [Spike](https://github.com/PSAL-POSTECH/riscv-isa-sim.git) from source for advanced users.
```bash
bash scripts/build_from_source.sh
```
The script clones each dep at the tag pinned in [`thirdparty/github-releases.json`](thirdparty/github-releases.json), the same manifest the CI docker image uses, so a from-source build matches the docker env.
### Run Examples
The `tests` directory contains several AI workload examples.
```bash
python tests/ops/gemm/test_matmul.py 
```
The result is written to `${TORCHSIM_LOG_PATH}/togsim_result/XXX.log`. The log file contains detailed core, memory, and interconnect stats.

### Run Your Own Model on PyTorchSim
You can run your own PyTorch model on PyTorchSim by setting up a custom NPU device.  
This method also applies when you want to simulate models beyond the provided examples.
```python
import torch

device = torch.device("npu:0")

# Declare your own model (e.g. resnet18 from torchvision)
from torchvision.models import resnet18
model = resnet18().eval()
x = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224, dtype=torch.float32)

# Move model and input tensors to the custom device
model.to(device)
x = x.to(device)

# Compile and run the model with PyTorchSim
compiled_model = torch.compile(dynamic=False)(model)
y = compiled_model(x)
```
`model` is your PyTorch model to be simulated, and `x` is the input tensor.
PyTorchSim automatically generates a Tile-Operation Graph (TOG), and runs it through the TOGSim backend.

### Result
Running log in CLI
```bash

```

Simulation consists of three steps

1. `Gem5` obtains compute latency for TOG.
2. `Spike` verifies the output code. It can also be used to model data-dependent timings.
3. `TOGSim` simulates an NPU architecture.

The log contains memory & core stats.

```
The log is dumped in `TORCHSIM_LOG_PATH` and you can set the path as below.
```bash
export TORCHSIM_LOG_PATH=/tmp/torchinductor # output file dump path
```

## Training
`backward()` automatically generates TOG and executes simulation for backward propagation. If you want to simulate optimizers on NPU units, you can compile the optimizer’s step function.
```python
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
compiled_step = torch.compile(dynamic=False)(optimizer.step)

optimizer.zero_grad()
loss.backward()
compiled_step()
```
`tests/models/test_mlp.py` provides an example of MLP training.

## One TOGSim session, one continuous log

By default, each compiled operation can run TOGSim in a standalone way—typically **one simulator process and one log file per kernel**. That matches single-kernel workflows but splits traces when you run many forwards in a row.

`with TOGSimulator(config_path=...)` keeps **one TOGSim session** open for the block: successive calls (e.g. multiple `compiled_model(...)` forwards) run in sequence in the same process, so the timeline and shared resources continue in a single log instead of restarting for every op. `TOGSIM_CONFIG` is set to the given YAML for the block so codegen and TOGSim still share one hardware file.

Use the same API you already use; only wrap the region you want co-simulated:

```python
import torch
from Simulator.simulator import TOGSimulator

# ... build model, torch.compile, tensors on npu:0 as usual ...

with TOGSimulator(config_path=config):
    y = compiled_model(x)
```

<a id="multi-tenancy"></a>

## Multi-tenancy and explicit scheduling (`launch_model`)

For **multi-tenant** or **interleaved** execution, you usually need to attach a **timestamp** and a `stream_index` to each launch so the simulator can order work correctly. Use `torch.npu.launch_model(compiled_model, *inputs, stream_index=..., timestamp=...)` for that; plain `compiled_model(x)` does not carry those parameters.

`stream_index` is the **request-queue / partition index** in the TOGSim config: it must match the **values** in the `partition` map (each queue index is mapped to a **core**). For example, `stream_index=0` goes to the queue bound to `core_0`, `stream_index=1` to the queue for `core_1`, and so on.

`timestamp`** is in **nanoseconds** (simulation time for ordering launches). Use `0` when you do not need explicit times beyond submission order.

```python
with TOGSimulator(config_path=config):
    torch.npu.launch_model(opt_model1, x1, stream_index=0, timestamp=0)
    torch.npu.launch_model(opt_model2, x2, stream_index=1, timestamp=0)
    torch.npu.synchronize()
    torch.npu.launch_model(opt_model1, x1, stream_index=0, timestamp=0)
    torch.npu.launch_model(opt_model2, x2, stream_index=1, timestamp=0)
```

Here `synchronize()` acts as a barrier: it does not return until every `launch_model` issued **above** it has finished in the simulator. The later pair of `launch_model` calls therefore runs only after those earlier models have fully completed—so the sync is the point in the timeline where **all preceding launches are done**.

```bash
python tests/system/test_scheduler.py
```

Use a TOGSim config(`.yml`) that defines **partitions** when mapping queues to cores, for example:

- `num_partition`: Number of independent request queues (valid `stream_index` values are `0 … num_partition-1`).
- `partition`: Maps each **core** name to a **queue index**; that index is the same `stream_index` you pass to `launch_model`.

```
  "num_partition" : 2,
  "partition": {
    "core_0": 0,
    "core_1": 1
  }
```

Here `stream_index=0` selects queue `0` (core_0), `stream_index=1` selects queue `1` (core_1).

### 3. Load generation (Poisson arrivals)

The `poisson_request_generator` in `Scheduler.scheduler` yields synthetic **arrival times** (in **milliseconds**). Merge those with `launch_model`: convert each time to **nanoseconds** for `timestamp`, set `stream_index` to the target partition queue, and run all launches inside one `with TOGSimulator(...)` so a **single** log captures the full trace.

```python
from Scheduler.scheduler import poisson_request_generator

model0_lambda = 5.0
model1_lambda = 3.0
max_time_msec = 1000.0  # Poisson horizon [ms]

events = []
for t in poisson_request_generator(model0_lambda, max_msec_time=max_time_msec):
    x = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224, device=device)
    events.append((t, 0, opt_model0, (x,)))  # stream_index 0 → queue / partition 0

for t in poisson_request_generator(model1_lambda, max_msec_time=max_time_msec):
    x = torch.randn(128, 768, device=device)
    events.append((t, 1, opt_model1, (x,)))  # stream_index 1 → queue / partition 1

with TOGSimulator(config_path=config):
    for t_msec, stream_index, model, args in events:
        torch.npu.launch_model(
            model,
            *args,
            stream_index=stream_index,
            timestamp=int(t_msec * 1e6),
        )  # ms → ns
```

The two Poisson streams are **combined and sorted by time** so launches follow a single global arrival order.

## Compiler Optimizations
PyTorchSim compiler supports several fusion optimizations:
- GEMM prologue fusion
- GEMM epilogue fusion
- GEMM reduction fusion
- CONV epilogue fusion

Depending on tensor shape, use different convolution template:
- Single batch optimization
- Multi-channel optimization

## Mapping
PyTorchSim provides three mapping strategies.
### Heuristic-based mapping
We adopted and modified heuristic-based mapping from [GEMMINI](https://github.com/ucb-bar/gemmini) by default, which maximizes the utilization of scratchpad memory.
### Auto-tuning
The heuristic method may not be optimal for all cases. PyTorchSim provides auto-tuning to find the best mapping for GEMM, CONV, and vector operations. It reduces the search space by sorting candidates based on scratchpad memory utilization and picking the top-k candidates. Search parameters include tile shape and vector lane stride.

To enable this, update your configuration file as follows:
```bash
"codegen_mapping_strategy" : "autotune"
```
### Manual setting
Users can use third-party mapping tools (e.g., Timeloop). You can explicitly set the mapping file path in the configuration file to apply your own mapping strategies.
```bash
"codegen_mapping_strategy" : "external",
"codegen_external_mapping_file" : "path/to/mapping_file.json",
```
Key: "M_N_K" for GEMM
```
{
    "512_2048_8192" : {
        "TILE_M" : 512,
        "TILE_K" : 512,
        "TILE_N" : 1024
    },
    "512_2048_2048" : {
        "TILE_M" : 512,
        "TILE_K" : 512,
        "TILE_N" : 1024
    },
    "2048_2048_512" : {
        "TILE_M" : 1024,
        "TILE_K" : 512,
        "TILE_N" : 512
    }
}
```

## L2 Cache
It supports L2 cache as persistent cache. User can provide software-managed allocation/eviction strategy for tensors with persistent cache.

Common Memory (CMEM) is a new feature introduced in the latest TPUs (newer than TPUv3). Multiple cores share this memory, which provides high bandwidth. Reusable tensors are stored and loaded from CMEM to avoid off-chip traffic. Our L2 cache can work like CMEM.

To allocate a tensor in L2 cache, set the environment variable as shown below. The `tpuv4` directory provides example plans for L2 cache obtained from TPUv4 profiling.
```bash
export SRAM_BUFFER_PLAN_PATH=tpuv4/gemm_plan.py
```
The L2 cache strategy file is composed as follows:
```
plan = {
    "arg0_1"
}
```
In this example, only one input tensor is registered in L2 cache. You can refer to the tensor name from the wrapper code. After running the code, you can find the wrapper codegen path in the [result](#result) section.

Last but not least, you must set `l2d_type` and `l2d_config` in the [TOGSim config](#togsim-configuration) to use L2 cache. The `l2d_config` follows the same configuration method as [AccelSim](https://github.com/accel-sim/accel-sim-framework).

## Compiler Configuration
`PyTorchSimFrontend/extension_config.py` contains target hardware configuration to compile.

You can configure these options using environment variables.
```bash
export TORCHSIM_DIR=/workspace/PyTorchSim # home directory

# Plan which tensors are allocated in TPUv4's CMEM
export SRAM_BUFFER_PLAN_PATH=/workspace/PyTorchSim/tpuv4/gemm_plan.py
export TORCHSIM_USE_TIMING_POOLING=0 # use lightweight pooling for timing
```
## TOGSim Configuration
![NPU_Core](./docs/npu_core.jpg)

The `configs/` directory holds **YAML** (`.yml`) hardware descriptions. Set `TOGSIM_CONFIG` to one of these files. The **same file** is read by the **compiler** (`PyTorchSimFrontend/extension_config.py`) for `vpu_*`, `pytorchsim_*`, and `codegen_*` fields, and by **TOGSim** (`TOGSim/src/Common.cc`) for the simulator-specific keys below.

### Key fields (quick reference)

One-line meaning for each group (details in the YAML block above).

- **Core (`num_cores`, `core_freq_mhz`, `core_stats_print_period_cycles`, `num_systolic_array_per_core`, optional `core_type`, STONNE keys)**: how many cores, their clock, stats cadence, systolic count per core, and optional non-default mesh vs STONNE mix.
- **VPU (`vpu_*`)**: vector lane count, per-lane scratchpad (KB), and vector register width—**compiler** uses these for tiling/codegen.
- **DRAM (`dram_type`, `dram_channels`, …)**: `ramulator2` uses `ramulator_config_path`; `simple` uses fixed latency and optional bandwidth caps (`dram_bandwidth_gbps_*`, `dram_freq_mhz` when capped). `dram_num_partitions` splits channels for NUMA-style addressing.
- **Interconnect (`icnt_*`, `booksim_config_path`)**: `simple` adds fixed hop latency (`icnt_latency_cycles`); `booksim2` points at a BookSim2 topology file.
- **Codegen (`codegen_*`)**: mapping strategy (heuristic / autotune / external-hybrid), external JSON path, autotune search limits, and fusion/optimization set for the PyTorch compiler path.
- **L2 (`l2d_type`, `l2d_config`, optional `l2d_hit_latency`)**: optional data cache between cores and DRAM; `l2d_config` uses AccelSim-style cache geometry strings.
- **Scheduler (`scheduler`, `num_partition`, `partition`)**: request queues per partition and `core_i` → queue index mapping for multi-tenant / `launch_model` routing.
- **`pytorchsim_functional_mode`**: **`1`** runs **Spike** on generated code; **`0`** skips it for faster iteration.
- **`pytorchsim_timing_mode`**: **`1`** keeps the cycle-aware tile-graph path that feeds **TOGSim**; **`0`** turns that timing path off (functional-style runs; often paired with `pytorchsim_functional_mode` in tutorial configs).

## Tutorial
Check out our [ISPASS 2026 tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYIb5dkr4isJ1ERKTKFoWdCKMUOaay2Nn) to learn:
- PyTorchSim architecture, motivation, and design goals
- The end-to-end PyTorch compilation pipeline (PyTorch code → FX → MLIR → LLVM → ISA)
- TPU-style NPU architecture and memory hierarchy
- Running and analyzing operators and DNN models in PyTorchSim
- Scheduling, mapping, optimization, and performance analysis tools
- Extending PyTorchSim with custom NPU ISA instructions

For tutorial setup, please refer to the [JupyterHub setup guide](https://github.com/PSAL-POSTECH/PyTorchSim/blob/ispass2026/tutorial/jupyterhub/README.md).

## Future Works
We plan to broaden **model coverage** (more workloads), support **dynamic-shape**, and extend **eager-mode** integration so a wider range of PyTorch programs can be simulated.
